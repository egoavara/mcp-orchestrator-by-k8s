# Feature Specification: gRPC Service Management Web UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-grpc-web-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "spec/service.proto 에 GRPC 서비스가 있어. 너는 이 서비스를 UI를 통해 관리 가능한 웹 페이지를 만들어야 해. 기본적인 구조는 crates/mcp-orchestrator/ 에 있는 걸 참조하고 rust yew 기반으로 구현해야 해"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Manage MCP Templates (Priority: P1)

An administrator needs to view all available MCP templates and create new templates to define reusable MCP server configurations. This is the foundation for managing the entire system since templates are required to create MCP servers.

**Why this priority**: Templates are the core building blocks. Without template management, users cannot create or manage MCP servers effectively. This is the most fundamental administrative task.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the templates page, viewing the list of existing templates, creating a new template with sample data, and verifying it appears in the list. Delivers immediate value by enabling template management without requiring other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the web UI, **When** user navigates to templates page, **Then** user sees a list of all existing MCP templates with their names and basic information
2. **Given** user is on templates page, **When** user clicks "Create Template" and fills in required fields (name, image, command), **Then** new template is created and appears in the list
3. **Given** user views template list, **When** user clicks on a template name, **Then** user sees detailed information about that template including all configuration parameters
4. **Given** user views a template detail, **When** user clicks "Delete Template", **Then** system confirms deletion and removes the template from the list

---

### User Story 2 - Manage Namespaces (Priority: P2)

An administrator needs to organize MCP servers and related resources into logical groups (namespaces) for better organization and access control.

**Why this priority**: Namespaces provide essential organizational structure and isolation between different projects or teams. Critical for multi-tenant scenarios but can be deferred if single-tenant usage is acceptable initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the namespaces page, creating a new namespace with a name and optional description, viewing namespace details, and deleting a namespace. Works independently without requiring templates or servers to be created.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the web UI, **When** user navigates to namespaces page, **Then** user sees all existing namespaces
2. **Given** user is on namespaces page, **When** user creates a new namespace with a unique name, **Then** namespace is created and appears in the list
3. **Given** user views namespace list, **When** user selects a namespace, **Then** user sees all resources (templates, servers, secrets, limits) within that namespace
4. **Given** user views a namespace, **When** user attempts to delete namespace with existing resources, **Then** system shows error message indicating resources must be deleted first

---

### User Story 3 - Monitor MCP Servers (Priority: P3)

An administrator wants to view all running MCP server instances and their current status to monitor the health of the system.

**Why this priority**: Monitoring is important for operations but can be deferred since basic CRUD operations are more critical. Users can initially rely on Kubernetes tools for monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the servers page and viewing the list of running MCP servers with their status, namespace, and template information. Works without requiring any server creation if test data exists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the web UI, **When** user navigates to servers page, **Then** user sees all MCP server instances across all namespaces
2. **Given** user views server list, **When** user filters by namespace, **Then** user sees only servers in selected namespace
3. **Given** user views a server, **When** user checks server status, **Then** user sees current state (running, pending, failed) and basic metrics
4. **Given** user views server details, **When** user clicks on template name, **Then** user is navigated to the template details page

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Secrets (Priority: P4)

An administrator needs to securely store and manage sensitive configuration data (API keys, credentials) that MCP servers require.

**Why this priority**: Secrets are necessary for servers that require authentication but can be managed manually initially. Important for production security but not critical for initial MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing secrets page, creating a new secret with key-value pairs in a specific namespace, viewing secret metadata (not values for security), and deleting secrets. Independent of server operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on secrets page, **When** user creates a new secret with name and key-value pairs, **Then** secret is stored securely in the selected namespace
2. **Given** user views secrets list, **When** user selects a secret, **Then** user sees secret metadata but not the actual secret values (for security)
3. **Given** user views a secret, **When** user clicks "Update Secret", **Then** user can modify secret values securely
4. **Given** user views a secret, **When** user deletes secret that is in use by a server, **Then** system shows warning about affected servers

---

### User Story 5 - Configure Resource Limits (Priority: P5)

An administrator wants to set resource constraints (CPU, memory) for MCP server instances to prevent resource exhaustion.

**Why this priority**: Resource limits are important for production stability but can use defaults initially. Least critical for MVP since Kubernetes provides default resource management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing resource limits page, creating a new limit configuration with CPU and memory values, associating it with a namespace, and verifying it appears in the list. Works without requiring active servers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on resource limits page, **When** user creates a new resource limit with CPU and memory values, **Then** limit configuration is saved for the namespace
2. **Given** user views resource limits, **When** user selects a limit, **Then** user sees current CPU and memory constraints
3. **Given** user views a resource limit, **When** user updates the values, **Then** new limits are applied to future server instances in that namespace
4. **Given** user views a resource limit, **When** user deletes it, **Then** system shows which servers will be affected

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user tries to delete a namespace that contains active MCP servers?
- How does system handle network failures when communicating with gRPC backend?
- What happens when user creates a template with invalid Docker image name?
- How does system handle concurrent edits to the same resource by multiple administrators?
- What happens when gRPC service is unavailable or restarting?
- How does system display very long lists of resources (pagination/infinite scroll)?
- What happens when user tries to create a secret with duplicate key names?
- How does system handle special characters in resource names?

- **SC-005**: Administrators successfully complete namespace creation and template assignment on first attempt 90% of the time
- **SC-006**: Zero secret values are exposed in the UI or browser console for security compliance
- **SC-007**: Web UI remains functional and shows appropriate error messages when backend gRPC service is unavailable
- **SC-008**: Users can locate a specific resource using search/filter in lists containing 100+ items within 10 seconds

## Assumptions

- Web UI will be accessed through modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled
- Users accessing the UI have appropriate permissions to manage MCP resources
- gRPC backend service is accessible from the web UI deployment environment
- Users are familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts like namespaces and resource limits
- Docker image names follow standard Docker registry format
- Resource limits use standard Kubernetes resource units (CPU cores, memory in Mi/Gi)
- Web UI will use standard HTTP status codes and error messages from gRPC service
- Authentication and authorization will be handled by existing system mechanisms
- The Yew framework provides sufficient capabilities for gRPC communication (likely through gRPC-Web or REST gateway)

## Dependencies

- gRPC service implementation in mcp-orchestrator must be running and accessible
- Protocol buffer definitions in spec/service.proto must be stable
- Kubernetes cluster must be accessible for backend operations
- Rust Yew framework and related dependencies must be compatible with project requirements
- gRPC-Web proxy or REST gateway may be needed since gRPC is not directly callable from browsers
