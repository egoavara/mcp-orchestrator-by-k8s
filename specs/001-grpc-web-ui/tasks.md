# Tasks: gRPC Service Management Web UI

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-grpc-web-ui/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - tests excluded from task list.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend**: `crates/mcp-orchestrator-front/src/`
- **Shared Proto**: `crates/proto/src/`
- **Build Config**: `crates/mcp-orchestrator-front/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Templates**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Namespaces**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, but integrates with US1 via namespace selector
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Servers**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 (template links) but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Secrets**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US2 (namespace selection) for context
- **User Story 5 (P5) - Resource Limits**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, referenced by US1 (templates)

### Within Each User Story

- Models before API clients
- API clients before pages
- List pages before detail pages
- Detail pages before forms
- Core pages before integration with other stories
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T009-T023 can run in parallel (all different files)
- **Phase 3-7 (User Stories)**: 
  - Once Foundational complete, ALL user stories can start in parallel with different team members
  - Within each story: Models and API clients (marked [P]) can run in parallel
  - Example US1: T026 and T027 can run together
  - Example US2: T034, T035, T036 can run together
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: T078-T086 can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Templates)

```bash
# Step 1: Launch model and API client together
Task T026: "Create Template model wrapper in src/models/template.rs"
Task T027: "Implement templates API client in src/api/templates.rs"

# Step 2: After both complete, build pages sequentially
Task T028: "Create TemplateList page" (depends on T026, T027)
Task T029: "Create TemplateDetail page" (depends on T026, T027)
Task T030: "Create TemplateForm component" (depends on T026, T027)
```

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Phase

With 5 developers, once Phase 2 completes:

```bash
Developer A ‚Üí Phase 3: User Story 1 (Templates)
Developer B ‚Üí Phase 4: User Story 2 (Namespaces)  
Developer C ‚Üí Phase 5: User Story 3 (Servers)
Developer D ‚Üí Phase 6: User Story 4 (Secrets)
Developer E ‚Üí Phase 7: User Story 5 (Resource Limits)

All stories complete and integrate independently!
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚Üí Trunk configured, dependencies ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚Üí Router, components, API client base ready
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Templates) ‚Üí T026-T033
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test template CRUD independently
5. Build and deploy MVP (`trunk build --release`)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (25 tasks)
2. Add US1 (Templates) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy MVP (8 tasks)
3. Add US2 (Namespaces) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (11 tasks)
4. Add US3 (Servers) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (10 tasks)
5. Add US4 (Secrets) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (12 tasks)
6. Add US5 (Resource Limits) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (11 tasks)
7. Polish all stories ‚Üí Final release (13 tasks)

**Total: 90 tasks organized into 8 phases**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) together
2. Team completes Foundational (Phase 2) together - CRITICAL checkpoint
3. Once Foundational done, split team across user stories by priority:
   - Senior dev: US1 (Templates) - most critical
   - Mid dev: US2 (Namespaces) + US4 (Secrets) - related
   - Junior dev: US3 (Servers) - read-only, simpler
   - Another dev: US5 (Resource Limits) - independent
4. Stories complete in parallel, integrate cleanly
5. Team reconvenes for Polish phase

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **File size limit**: 300 lines per file (project guideline) - split if needed
- **Security**: T065 explicitly validates secret values never exposed
- **Testing**: Tests not requested in spec, excluded from task list
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable per spec requirements
- **MVP scope**: User Story 1 (Templates) delivers immediate value - 33 total tasks
- **Full feature**: All 5 user stories + polish - 90 total tasks
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop after each phase to validate story works independently
- **Success criteria**: Phase 8 (T089) validates all 8 success criteria from spec.md
