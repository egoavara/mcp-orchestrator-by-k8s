# Specification Quality Checklist: gRPC Service Management Web UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓
- Spec focuses on WHAT users need (manage templates, namespaces, servers, secrets, limits) without specifying HOW to implement
- Business value is clear (administrative efficiency, resource organization, monitoring)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "System MUST display all MCP templates", "System MUST validate user input")
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (e.g., "under 2 minutes", "within 500ms", "95% of operations", "90% success rate")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes like "administrators can create a template" rather than implementation details)
- All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- 8 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, boundary conditions, and failure modes
- Scope is bounded to gRPC service management UI
- Dependencies (gRPC service, Kubernetes, Yew framework) and assumptions (browser requirements, user knowledge) are documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✓
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5) cover all primary flows with independent test criteria
- Success criteria define measurable outcomes (completion time, response time, success rates, security compliance)
- No framework-specific or implementation details in the spec (appropriately mentions "Yew framework" only in assumptions/dependencies section for technical context)
